# CloudBees Core Quickstart
Scaling and managing CI/CD across the enterprise is challenging. Jenkins is a popular choice for automating builds, tests, and deployments yet it is not without challenges. CloudBees extends the open-source Jenkins platform with critical features like RBAC and high-availability, yet organizations still struggle with managing infrastructure, scaling to accommodate additional teams, and rolling out updates when running CloudBees Jenkins on traditional VMs/bare-metal servers.

CloudBees Core is an enterprise-level CI/CD platform based on Jenkins which runs on top of Kubernetes. The combination of CloudBees and Kubernetes gives enterprises the ability to scale CI/CD more easily and simplifies the management of Jenkins across an organization: managed masters for each application team, ephemeral build agents, immutable container images, and centralized administration.

Perficient offers a CloudBees Core Quickstart to help organizations get started with CloudBees Core on Kubernetes. The first considerations are where and how to run Kubernetes. Whether you are considering a hosted Kubernetes offering on public cloud, or on-premise flavors such as OpenShift Container Platform and Pivotal Container Service, Perficient has the skills to help your company standup the cluster and get started. In addition, we will install CloudBees Core and perform critical configuration steps up front: integration with corporate user directories, RBAC, best practice tuning, pod template definitions, and core plugin configurations. Beyond these foundational steps, the offering also includes pipeline development for a small number of applications.

## Whatâ€™s Included
- 2-3 day kickoff event for key decision-making and planning
- Solution Architecture documentation including descriptions, diagrams, implementation notes, and usage guidelines
- Deployment of your flavor of Kubernetes, e.g. Amazon EKS, Google GKE, Azure Kubernetes, OpenShift, or Pivotal Container Service
- Installation of CloudBees Core
- Configuration of CloudBees Core including LDAP/AD integration, plugin configuration, pod template definitions, RBAC, and best practice tuning
- Pipeline development for 1-3 applications
- Summary and closeout meeting

The Kubernetes cluster installation and CloudBees Core installation/configuration is intended to help clients get up and running quickly. In the interest of time and limiting scope, Kubernetes cluster setup and CloudBees Core installation/configuration is limited to a set of critical items that allows clients to realize value quickly while simultaneously identifying areas for incremental improvement.

## Target Prospects
- Organizations new to Jenkins and CloudBees who would like to accelerate implementation
- Existing Jenkins or CloudBees users running on traditional VMs (configurations and pipelines will be migrated)

## Duration
This engagement typically lasts **6-8 weeks**. Major dependencies include where to run Kubernetes, infrastructure provisioning for on-premise flavors, license procurement, and requirements gathering for container image development and pipeline development.

## Resourcing
- 1 Solution Architect focused on Kubernetes cluster setup and configuration, and managing the overall engagement
- 1 Technical Architect focused on CloudBees Core installation and configuration
- 1 Technical Consultant to assist with development and engineering tasks
- (Optional) 1 Business Analyst/Project Manager to manage the engagement backlog, run daily stand-ups, and coordinate deliverables
